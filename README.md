# Weather Forecasts w/ Hashes

You are a weather reporter for the local news station.  You get data feeds from
several different sources, and you need to be able to analyze them and extract
the high and low temperatures for each day.

## Instructions

Run `ruby bin/level_00.rb` and look at the output.  Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to get all of the other levels to print out with _exactly_ the
same output.

So if you run `ruby bin/level_02.rb` the output should be identical to the
output of `ruby bin/level_00.rb` - that's how you know you've done the right thing.

See `bin/level_00.rb` and `bin/level_01.rb` as examples of what your code should look like.
